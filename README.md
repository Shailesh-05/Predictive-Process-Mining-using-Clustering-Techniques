# Predictive-Process-Mining-using-Clustering-Techniques
Built a hybrid framework of clustering and supervised algorithm for classifying the process data of patients in a hospital.
->Created a tool for automatically labelling process data of patients in a hospital using a set of Linear Temporal Logic rules.
->Applied Gaussian Mixture Model & DBSCAN resp. for clustering data into similar groups after proper data pre-processing.
->Experimented using Decision Tree & Random Forest (with each of the above clustering techniques) to classify the 
processes into Normal and Deviant categories.
->Achieved best results with GMM & Decision Tree Combination.
